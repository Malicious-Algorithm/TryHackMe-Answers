This machine on "www.tryhackme.com" is called "Nmap" and here i'll demonstrate the nmap scripts i've runned against
 the given host.

1) Does the target (10.10.34.117)respond to ICMP (ping) requests (Y/N)?
	- No  -> ping -c 1 10.10.34.117    -> 100% packet loss


2)Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?
	- 999  -> sudo nmap -sX -Pn -vv 10.10.34.117 


3)There is a reason given for this -- what is it?
	- no-response  -> sudo nmap -sX -Pn -vv 10.10.34.117

		this is beacose the ports are open|filtered by the firewall

4)Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?
	- 5  -> sudo nmap -sS -Pn -vv 10.10.34.117

	Sample:

3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server syn-ack ttl 125


5)Open Wireshark (see Cryillic's Wireshark Room for instructions) and perform a TCP Connect scan against port 80 on the target, monitoring the results. Make sure you understand what's going on.

	-No answer needed 

6)Deploy the ftp-anon script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N)
	-Yes

	-> locate ftp-anon
 	-> i have it 
	-> sudo nmap -Pn -p21 --script=ftp.anon.nse -vv 10.10.34.117

Well this was basic scanning using nmap. But it was worth it, simply due to the fact that i get to review lots of things i've learned on youtube videos. Yay!
